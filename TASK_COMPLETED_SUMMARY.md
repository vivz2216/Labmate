# ✅ Task Completed: Dynamic Username in File Paths

## 🎯 Objective

Implement dynamic username extraction from the database to display personalized file paths in screenshots.

**Requirement:**
> When a user signs up with name "Vivek Pillai", the generated screenshots should display:  
> `C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py`  
> (using first name "Vivek" only, not the full name)

---

## ✅ Implementation Status: **COMPLETE**

### What Was Already Working

The system **already had** most of this feature implemented:

1. ✅ AI job processing (`task_service.py`) - Already extracting first name
2. ✅ Template files (`idle_theme.html`) - Already using `{{ username }}` variable
3. ✅ Screenshot service - Already accepting username parameter
4. ✅ User model - Already storing full name in database

### What Was Added

**Only one file needed updating:**

1. ✅ **`backend/app/routers/run.py`** - Added username extraction for regular (non-AI) jobs

**Changes Made:**
- Added `User` import to access user data
- Added logic to query user from database by `upload.user_id`
- Extract first name using `user.name.split()[0]`
- Pass `username` and `filename` to screenshot generation function

## 📋 Files Modified

### 1. backend/app/routers/run.py

**Lines Changed:** 
- Line 4: Added `User` to imports
- Lines 79-94: Added username extraction and passing to screenshot service

**Before:**
```python
screenshot_success, screenshot_path, width, height = await screenshot_service.generate_screenshot(
    code_snippet, output, request.theme, job.id
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Get user information for personalized display
user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == upload.user_id).first() if upload.user_id else None

# Extract first name from full name
if user and user.name:
    username = user.name.split()[0]  # Get first name only (e.g., "Vivek" from "Vivek Pillai")
else:
    username = "User"

# Use custom filename if provided, otherwise generate default
filename = getattr(upload, 'custom_filename', None) if upload else None
if not filename:
    filename = f"task{task_data['id']}.py"  # Default filename like task1.py

screenshot_success, screenshot_path, width, height = await screenshot_service.generate_screenshot(
    code_snippet, output, request.theme, job.id, username, filename
)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Signs Up**
   ```
   Name: "Vivek Pillai"
   Email: vivek@example.com
   ```

2. **Database Storage**
   ```sql
   users table:
   id=1, name="Vivek Pillai", email="vivek@example.com"
   ```

3. **User Uploads Assignment**
   ```
   Upload linked to user_id=1
   Custom filename: "exp5"
   ```

4. **Code Execution & Screenshot Generation**
   ```python
   # Backend queries user
   user = User(id=1, name="Vivek Pillai")
   
   # Extracts first name
   username = "Vivek Pillai".split()[0]  # → "Vivek"
   
   # Generates screenshot with personalized path
   Path: "C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py"
   ```

5. **Result**
   ```
   Screenshot displays:
   - Title: exp5.py - C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py
   - Shell: ========== RESTART: C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py ==========
   ```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario

1. Sign up as "Vivek Pillai"
2. Upload a Python assignment document
3. Set custom filename as "exp5"
4. Generate screenshots (either AI or regular mode)
5. **Expected Result:** Screenshots show `C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py`

### Different Users

| User Name          | First Name Used | Path Displayed                          |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Vivek Pillai      | Vivek           | C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/...   |
| Sarah Johnson     | Sarah           | C:/Users/Sarah/OneDrive/Desktop/...   |
| Muhammad Ali      | Muhammad        | C:/Users/Muhammad/OneDrive/Desktop/... |
| Priya             | Priya           | C:/Users/Priya/OneDrive/Desktop/...   |

## 🚀 Deployment

### Changes Applied

1. ✅ Code changes committed
2. ✅ Backend container restarted
3. ✅ Feature is now live

### Services Status

```
✅ Backend:  Running on http://localhost:8000
✅ Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ Database: Healthy (PostgreSQL)
```

## 🎨 Technical Details

### Name Extraction Logic

```python
# Simple and effective
first_name = full_name.split()[0]

# Examples:
"Vivek Pillai" → "Vivek"
"John Doe" → "John"
"Sarah" → "Sarah"
```

### Fallback Behavior

```python
if user and user.name:
    username = user.name.split()[0]
else:
    username = "User"  # Default fallback
```

### Template Integration

```jinja2
<!-- Jinja2 template variable -->
C:/Users/{{ username }}/OneDrive/Desktop/{{ filename }}

<!-- After rendering -->
C:/Users/Vivek/OneDrive/Desktop/exp5.py
```
