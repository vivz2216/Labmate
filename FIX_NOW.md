# üî¥ URGENT: Fix the 500 Error in 3 Steps

## ‚ùå The Problem

You're getting a **500 Internal Server Error** because the OpenAI API key is still a placeholder!

Current key in `docker-compose.yml`:
```
sk-proj-YOUR_API_KEY_HERE_REPLACE_THIS
```

This is NOT a real API key - it needs to be replaced with YOUR actual key.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys**
2. Sign in (or create account if you don't have one)
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. **Copy the entire key** (it starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** You also need to add billing:
- Go to: **https://platform.openai.com/account/billing**
- Add a payment method
- Add at least $5 credit

---

### Step 2: Update docker-compose.yml

1. Open `docker-compose.yml` in your editor
2. Find **line 28** (it's already open in your IDE!)
3. Replace this line:
   ```yaml
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_API_KEY_HERE_REPLACE_THIS
   ```
   
   With YOUR actual key:
   ```yaml
   - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_PASTE_IT_HERE
   ```

4. **Save the file**

---

### Step 3: Restart Docker

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Wait 15-20 seconds for services to start.

## üß™ Test It

1. Go to **http://localhost:3000**
2. Upload your assignment again
3. ‚úÖ It should work now!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Don't Have an OpenAI Account

### Option 1: Create Free OpenAI Account
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/signup
2. Verify email
3. Add payment method (required even for trial)
4. Get $5 free trial credit
5. Follow steps above

### Option 2: Use Temporary Test Mode
**NOT RECOMMENDED** - The AI features won't work without a real key.

## üí∞ Cost After You Fix It

With your API key:
- **Per assignment: ~$0.04**
- **$5 credit: ~125 assignments**
- **Very affordable!**

---

## üîç How to Verify Your Key Works

After updating and restarting, run this test:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python -c "import openai, os; openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'); print(openai.Model.list())"
```

If it shows a list of models ‚Üí ‚úÖ Key works!  
If it shows an error ‚Üí ‚ùå Key is invalid, check it again
