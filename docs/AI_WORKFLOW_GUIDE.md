# ü§ñ LabMate AI - Complete AI Workflow Guide

## üìã Overview

LabMate AI now uses a **fully AI-powered workflow** that intelligently analyzes your lab assignments, executes code, generates screenshots, and creates complete reports automatically.

---

## üîÑ The Complete Workflow

### **Step 1: Upload File** üì§
- Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- Upload your lab assignment (DOCX or PDF)
- The file is parsed and sent to OpenAI for analysis

### **Step 2: AI Review** üß†
The AI analyzes your document and identifies:

1. **Screenshot Requests**: Code blocks that need to be executed with terminal output screenshots
2. **Answer Requests**: Theory questions that need AI-generated explanations
3. **Code Execution Tasks**: Code that should be run and documented

For each task, the AI provides:
- `question_context`: The relevant question/section from your document
- `task_type`: What kind of task it is (screenshot_request, answer_request, code_execution)
- `suggested_code`: Python code to execute (if applicable)
- `confidence`: How confident the AI is (0-1)
- `suggested_insertion`: Where to place the result (below_question or bottom_of_page)
- `brief_description`: A caption for the screenshot or answer
- `follow_up`: Optional questions the AI needs answered

**Your Control Panel:**
- ‚úÖ Select which tasks you want to execute
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edit the suggested code before execution
- üìç Choose insertion location (below question or bottom of page)
- üé® Pick screenshot theme (IDLE or VS Code style)
- üí¨ Answer any follow-up questions from the AI

### **Step 3: Execute & Report** üöÄ

Once you confirm your selections, the backend:

#### For Code Execution Tasks:
1. **Validates Code**: Checks against a security blocklist (no file system access, no network, etc.)
2. **Docker Execution**: Runs code in an isolated Python container with resource limits
3. **Capture Output**: Records stdout, stderr, and exit code
4. **Generate Screenshots**: 
   - Creates an editor-style code view (syntax highlighted)
   - Creates a terminal output view
   - Applies your chosen theme (IDLE or VS Code)
5. **AI Caption**: Generates a 1-2 line description of the result

#### For Answer Requests:
1. **AI Generation**: OpenAI writes a detailed answer to the theory question
2. **Context Aware**: Uses the assignment context to provide relevant explanations
3. **Formatted**: Properly formatted for insertion into Word documents

#### Document Composition:
1. **Smart Insertion**: Places screenshots and answers based on your preferences:
   - `below_question`: Directly after the related question
   - `bottom_of_page`: At the end of the document
2. **Professional Formatting**: Maintains document structure and styling
3. **Caption Integration**: Adds AI-generated captions to screenshots
4. **Final Report**: Generates a downloadable DOCX file

### **Step 4: Download** ‚¨áÔ∏è
- Preview all screenshots and AI answers
- Reorder or remove items if needed
- Click "Compose Report" to generate the final document
- Download your completed lab report!

## üéØ Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Python Lab Assignment
**Document contains:**
```
Question 1: Write a Python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Question 2: Explain recursion in Python with an example.

Question 3: Implement a linear search algorithm.
```

**AI Analysis Will Suggest:**
1. **Task 1** (code_execution):
   - Generate Fibonacci code
   - Run in Docker
   - Screenshot: code + terminal output
   - Insert: below Question 1

2. **Task 2** (answer_request):
   - AI writes explanation of recursion
   - Includes a recursive factorial example
   - Insert: below Question 2

3. **Task 3** (code_execution):
   - Generate linear search code
   - Run with sample data
   - Screenshot: code + search results
   - Insert: below Question 3

**Result**: A complete Word document with code, outputs, screenshots, and explanations!

```python
def add(a, b)
    return a + b
```
```

### 3. **Theory Questions**
Make questions specific:
- ‚úÖ "Explain recursion in Python with an example"
- ‚ùå "Recursion"

### 4. **Code Requirements**
Be clear about what you want:
- ‚úÖ "Write a program to sort a list using bubble sort"

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Can I still run code manually?**  
A: No, the manual workflow has been removed. The AI workflow is smarter and more capable.

**Q: What if the AI misses something?**  
A: You can edit the suggested code or answer the AI's follow-up questions to provide more context.

**Q: Can I use my own code?**  
A: Yes! If your document contains code blocks, the AI will detect and use them. You can also edit any suggested code.

**Q: Is my code safe?**  
A: Yes! All code runs in isolated Docker containers with strict security policies. No network access, no file system writes, limited resources.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: With `gpt-3.5-turbo`, expect ~$0.05-0.15 per assignment. With `gpt-4`, it's ~$0.20-0.50.

**Q: Can I preview before downloading?**  
A: Yes! After execution, you'll see all screenshots and answers. You can reorder, remove, or regenerate before composing the final report.
